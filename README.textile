h1. Introduction

softignore.py is a plugin for hexchat that allows one to fade messages
for specified nicks. This is useful for rooms with lots of bot
messages.

This script was originally taken from
http://hbfs.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/soft-ignore-filter-buggers-in-xchat/. I've
updated it to work with later python versions and the latest hexchat.
